## RaspberryDAO

RaspberryDAO is an ERC20 based governance mechanism.

DAOs are an effective and safe way to work with like-minded folks around the globe.

Think of them like an internet-native business that's collectively owned and managed by its members. They have built-in treasuries that no one has the authority to access without the approval of the group. Decisions are governed by proposals and voting to ensure everyone in the organization has a voice. [Read More About DAOs](https://ethereum.org/en/dao/)
